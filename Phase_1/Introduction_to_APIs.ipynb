    "API stands for Application Programming Interface. At some point or the other, large companies would build API for their products for their clients or internal use. It allows the company's application to communicate with another application. But what _exactly_ is an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Remote server \n",
    "When we think about the world of Web, we can think of it as a collection of _servers_. And servers are nothing but huge computers that store a huge amount of data from users and are optimized to process requests. For example, when you type in www.facebook.com, your browser sends a _request_ to the Facebook server, and gets a response from the server, thus interpreting the code and displaying your homepage. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, your browser is the _client_, and Facebook’s server is an API. To put it broadly, whenever you visit a website, you are interacting with its API. However, an API isn’t the same as the remote server — rather it is the part of the server that receives __requests__ and sends __responses__.\n",
