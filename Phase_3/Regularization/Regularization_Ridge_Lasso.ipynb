    "## Part I. Regularizing a Model\n",
    "Even though Lasso and Ridge regressions are only used in regression, regularizing a model is a common procedure in the process of building machine learning models. It is an effectuve procedure for tackling the problem of overfitting. Generally speaking, applying regularization technique introduces some **bias** to the model, but reduces the **variance**, and therefore results in better performance in testing data. As you will see later in this module, models built from various classification algorithms often require tuning using regularization in order to overcome overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "What is regularization in the context of regression? As we recall, as the complexity of model increases, the model overfits and performance on the testing set decreases. Regularization techniques *shrinks* the regression coefficients such that the coefficients are not affecting the outcomes as much as they originally would have. In other words, using regularization applies a *penalty* to the coefficients of your regression model. Let's see how exactly Ridge regression and Lasso regression work to reduce variances in regression models and result in better fit. "

    "## Part II. Ridge Regression (L2 Norm)\n",
    "Before we dive into regularization, let's (re)visit a concept called **Cost Function**. A cost function is a measure of how good or bad the model is at estimating the relationship of our $X$ and $y$ variables. Usually, it is expressed in the difference between actual values and predicted values. For simple linear regression, the cost function is represented as:\n",
    "<center> $$ \\text{cost_function}= \\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \\sum( bx + b_0))^2$$\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "For linear regression with multiple predictors, the cost function is expressed as:\n",
    "$$ \\text{cost_function} = \\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \\sum_{j=1}^k(m_jx_{ij} + b))^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where k stands for number of predictors at jth term.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ridge regression applies a penalizing parameter $\\lambda$ *slope* $^2$, such that a small bias will be introduced to the entire model depending on the value of $\\lambda$, which is called a *hyperparameter*. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{cost_function_ridge}= \\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \\hat{y})^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \\sum_{j=1}^k(m_jx_{ij} + b))^2 + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^p m_j^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of applying such a penalizing parameter to the cost function, resulting a different regression model that minimizing the residual sum of square **and** the term $\\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^p m_j^2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Ridge regression improves the fit of the original regression line by introducing some bias/changing the slope and intercept of the original line. Recall the way we interpret a regression model Y = mx + b: with every unit increase in x, the outcome y increase by m unit. Therefore, the bigger the coefficient m is, the more the outcome is subjected to changes in predictor x. Ridge regression works by reducing the magnitude of the coefficient m and therefore reducing the effect the predictors have on the outcome. Let's look at a simple example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ridge regression penalty term contains all of the coefficients squared from the original regression line except for the intercept term. "

    "## Part III. Lasso Regression (L1 Norm)\n",
    "Lasso regression is very similar to Ridge regression except for one difference - the penalty term is not squared but the absolute values of the coefficients muliplied by lambda, expressed by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{cost_function_lasso}=  \\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \\sum_{j=1}^k(m_jx_{ij} + b))^2 + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^p \\mid m_j \\mid$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest difference in Ridge and Lasso is that Lasso simultaneously performs variable selection: some coefficients are shrunk to 0, rendering them nonexistence in the original regression model. Therefore, Lasso regression performs very well when you have higher dimensional dataset where some predictors are useless; whereas Ridge works best when all the predictors are needed. "
